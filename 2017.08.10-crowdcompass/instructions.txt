Since the event is over, the URLs in brute.sh and brute_harder.sh will need to
be updated to apply to your event.  After these are updated, just run this:

./brute_harder.sh fname lname

It will probably take about 20 minutes, but at then end it should print the
correct PIN, which you can just enter into the application to log into that
account.  Just watch the output.*.txt files for the "Correct answer" E.g.:

watch grep "Correct answer" output.*.txt
