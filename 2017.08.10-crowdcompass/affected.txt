Application version 5.9 was tested for the brute force vulnerability, however
the bug could be fixed on the server side without the need to update the
client.  So while we believe this affects all versions of the app, this is
not all that relevant in this case.

It is also important to note that NITEC17 was created by CrowdCompass, who
makes apps for hundreds of conferences.  These are packaged as different apps
in the app store, but they're affectively all the same application.  This has
not been tested on the other apps, but it is probable that 250+ applications
on the Google Play store share the same vulnerability.
