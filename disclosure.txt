Vulnerabilities reported to the vendor/developer will be disclosed to the public
after a patch is released, or 45 days after the initial report, regardless of
the existence or availability of patches or workarounds from affected vendors.
Extenuating circumstances, such as threats of an especially serious (or trivial)
nature, or situations that require changes to an established standard may result
in earlier or later disclosure.

Our disclosure policy is modeled after the one adopted by CERT
(https://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/vul-disclosure.cfm).
