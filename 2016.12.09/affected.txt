This bug affects MPlayer 1.1 through 1.2.1.  The file does not crash the latest
release, which is 1.3.0.

It might work for previous versions, but the next oldest release we could find
was 0.9.3 which requires version 2.95.x or 3.x of gcc (per ./configure).  We
tried using --disable-gcc-checking as is suggested in
DOCS/users_against_developers.html, however getline causes compilation errors.
Rather than downgrading from gcc 4.8 to 2.95.x or 3.x, we decided to abandon our
usual hunt to figure out where the bug was introduced, as it seemed to be more
trouble than it was worth.

So the bug was present from at least 2012.06.02 to 2016.02.16 (~3.5+ years).
