This bug affects avprobe (and other programs) from the libav package, versions
0.5.5 through 11.4.  Actually, this bug predated the entire libav project and
was inherited by them when they forked ffmpeg 0.5.4!  The file does not cause a
crash as of version 11.5 of the library.

For the ffmpeg project, it affects versions 0.5 through 1.0.10. Version 1.1 is
where it was patched.  Also please note that it might be in versions older than
0.5, that was just the oldest version available on https://ffmpeg.org/releases/

This means, in libav, the bug lasted from 2011.03.07 to 2016.02.04: ~5 years
In ffmpe, the bug lasted from AT LEAST 2009.03.10 to 2014.03.07: ~5 years
