This bug affects avprobe (and other programs) from the libav package, versions
0.5.5 through 11.4.  Actually, this bug predated the entire libav project and
was inherited by them when they forked ffmpeg 0.5.4!  The file does not cause a
crash as of version 11.5 of the library.

For the ffmpeg project, it affects versions ?-0.5.4-?

This means, in libav, the bug lasted from 2011.03.07 to 2016.02.04: ~5 years
